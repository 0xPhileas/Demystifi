# Blockchain

Blockchain is one of the most fundamental technology behind Web 3. You can think of it as a digital ledger or record of transactions that is duplicated and distributed across the entire network of computer systems on the blockchain.

In Web 2, if you want to transfer money to a friend using a banking app for example, the bank's central database will record that transaction. With blockchain in Web 3, there is no central authority that maintains the record - it is hosted by millions of computers across the world. This record of transactions, called blocks, are connected to each other in a chain. This ensures that the record cannot be altered or changed as it is distributed across many computers worldwide. Blockchain brings trust and transparency to the system without the need of a middleman.

# Node

Node refers to an active participant in a peer-to-peer decentralized network. Nodes allow decentralized protocols to operate in a distributed manner without relying on centralized intermediaries.

In web2, we connect to centralized servers hosted by companies to access services like social media, streaming apps, online marketplaces etc. However, in web3 - blockchains form global peer-to-peer networks that run on nodes operated by individuals and organizations worldwide.

Full nodes store the entire blockchain record and validate new transactions before adding them to the ledger. Light nodes on the other hand do not store the full history but can still interact with the network through their own personal backups. Together these nodes reach a decentralized consensus to process transactions and advance the blockchain in an open and collaborative manner.

Running a node represents intrinsic belief in decentralization and playing an active role in maintaining the integrity and resiliency of a given network in web3. Their role will continue gaining importance as new blockchain use-cases disrupt legacy institutions through the spread of open participation.

# Wallet

A crypto wallet in web3 is basically your personal gateway to interacting with blockchain-based applications in a safe and secure manner. It allows users to store, send and receive digital assets like cryptocurrencies and NFTs.

To visualize it better, think of a traditional wallet that holds your cash, cards and IDs. Similarly, a crypto wallet holds your private keys, which are long strings of numbers that prove your ownership of coins and tokens on the blockchain. Web3 wallets can be accessed through software, hardware or even paper forms for "cold" storage.

Some key functions of wallets are: safely storing login keys, managing multiple accounts across different networks (e.g. both Ethereum and Bitcoin addresses), facilitating crypto purchases and trades, integrating with DeFi dapps for activities like lending and borrowing.

Popular wallet options for beginners include Metamask, Coinbase Wallet and Trust Wallet. Make sure to choose a reputed software or hardware wallet, and never share your private keys with anyone to keep your funds secure in the brave new world of web3!

# NFT 

NFT stands for Non-Fungible Token. The name pretty much encapsulates what it is - it's a unique digital token that cannot be replaced with something else since it represents something one-of-a-kind.

Let me give you an example to help explain why NFTs are useful. In the physical world, collectibles like artworks and trading cards have value due to their scarcity and authenticity that is intrinsic to owning the original piece. In web2, this concept of originals didn't quite exist in the digital realm as anything online could be endlessly reproduced.

NFTs solve this problem. By attaching a non-exchangeable digital token to an artwork, song, video clip etc., it proves its authenticity and scarcity on the blockchain. Just like how a physical painting has value basis the reputation of the artist, NFTs represent verifiable digital ownership that can be stored and traded. NFTs allow creators to monetize their work and unlock unique experiences for collectors in web3.

# Token

A token in the world of web3 represents a unit of value that is powered by blockchain technology. There are generally two types of tokens - currency tokens and utility tokens.

Currency tokens function like digital money that can be used as a medium of exchange, store of value or unit of account. Popular examples are Bitcoin and Ethereum.

Utility tokens on the other hand are crypto assets that grant users access to specific products or services on a blockchain-based platform or application. Holding a utility token doesn't guarantee ownership in the company but may provide rights to its services. Many platforms launching in web3 issue their own native utility tokens to power transactions.

Tokens derive their value based on demand and usability within a given ecosystem. Currency tokens are valued due to their scarcity and purchasing power while people buy into utility tokens to access future projects. Blockchain's ability to tokenize assets breakthrough new ways to structure incentives for users and developers alike in the collaborative sharing economy of web3.


# Smart contract

A smart contract in web3 is basically a self-executing program stored on the blockchain that runs exactly as coded without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third-party interference.

To help understand, think of contracts in the real world. They typically require intermediaries like lawyers and courts to oversee terms are being followed properly. Smart contracts bridge this gap by digitizing the agreement and enforcing clauses objectively through code.

When deployed on blockchains like Ethereum, smart contracts can automate complex processes like financial loans, asset exchanges, crowdfunding campaigns and organizational governance in a decentralized way. They are designed to mitigate trust requirements through transparency and permanent storage on the immutable blockchain ledger.

Some key uses of smart contracts include distributing tokens, executing trades on DEXes, powering DeFi protocols for lending-borrowing and managing workflow on decentralized applications. Their self-enforcing nature paves the path to a more just system by reducing vulnerabilities associated with centralized intermediaries. Undoubtedly one of the most revolutionary aspects of the creator economy being built on web3!

# dApp

A dApp refers to a decentralized application that runs on peer-to-peer blockchain networks rather than a centralized platform. Just like how regular web2 apps are accessed through mobile phones and browsers, dApps aim to disrupt that model through open access.

In the current app stores run by companies, developers lack flexibility due to censorship, friction in publishing updates and high fees. This is where dApps come into play by creating open alternatives modeled after the internet's original principles of decentralization.

Being native to blockchains like Ethereum, dApps use smart contracts and tokens for varied functions. Popular examples include DEXes, DeFi platforms, peer-to-peer marketplaces and social networks. Users aren't required to sign up or pay subscription fees. Transactions are secure, transparent and the underlying protocols can't be controlled by any single entity.

Running on public networks, dApps aim to return control back to individuals while fueling a collaborative innovation economy where people are fairly incentivized. I'm hopeful advances in web3 will pave the path for a breakthrough in building a more connected and empowering future through open access!

# Minting

Minting in web3 parlance refers to the process of creating or generating a brand new non-fungible token (NFT) on the blockchain and making it available for others to discover, trade or own.

Just like how physical currencies are coined or made by a central bank, NFTs are "minted" by their creators on a blockchain before entering circulation. It involves providing details around ownership rights, scarcity, metadata and storage locations before deploying the smart contract to generate its new unique ID.

Popular minting platforms that allow creators to launch and sell their NFT projects include OpenSea, Rarible and Foundation. Users connect their digital wallets to deposit funds, approve minting and take ownership of newly created NFT tokens in return.

The minting process brings transparency to scarcity and provenance, empowering a permissionless innovation economy. It's opening up new revenue streams for content makers by digitizing creative work as verifiable collector's items through the ownership rights encoded by blockchain technology in web3. Exciting times ahead indeed for creative capitalism on the decentralized internet!

# Private Key

A private key is akin to your digital identity and the most critical thing responsible for securing your crypto assets in web3. It acts as the passcode that proves ownership of your blockchain wallet, just like a password for your online bank account or email.

To better understand what it is, think of real life keys to a safe deposit box that holds your most valuable possessions. Private keys serve a similar role in keeping your blockchain wallet and its contents protected. Keys are long random strings of numbers and letters that remain invisible to anyone else but you, just like a secret pin.

It's absolutely vital that private keys are kept private and never shared with others. Anyone having access to your private key can essentially impersonate you on the blockchain and initiate transactions like transferring cryptocurrencies out of your wallet. Hardware wallets provide extra security by keeping keys in isolated storage.

Proper private key management is key to ensuring funds aren't vulnerable to hacks or malicious attacks in the new digital frontier being built on decentralized networks. So take the necessary precautions to protect this credential that proves your identity in web3!

# Public Key 

A public key is essentially the cryptographic counterpart to a private key in web3. While the private key is meant to remain hidden and encrypted, the matching public key can be freely shared.

To draw an analogy, think of your private key as your home's front door lock that only you have the physical key to. Your public key would then act like the nameplate outside indicating your address.

Public keys serve as blockchain identifiers tied to your digital identity and wallet location. They allow others to send you crypto assets or interact with your smart contracts in a trustless manner without requiring to see your private keys.

Your public key is derived from the private key through cryptographic algorithm, meaning there is a one-way relationship between the two where one cannot be deduced from the other.

Public keys begin with identifiers denoting the blockchain network like 0x for Ethereum. Freely distributing this alphanumeric string allows transparency while private keys stay hidden similar to wallet passcodes never being exposed.

Together, the public-private key pair forms the basic authentication system securing all blockchain interactions and digital assets in the permissionless world of web3.

# Seed Phrase

A seed phrase, also called recovery phrase or backup phrase, is a unique set of words given out when a crypto wallet is first created. It acts as a backup for reconstructing your entire digital identity and restoring access in case private keys are lost.

To simplify the concept, think of a seed phrase like the password reset option companies provide just in case your account login is forgotten. With your 12 or 24 word mnemonic, wallets can always be recovered from scratch even if the device storing private keys malfunctions.

At the outset, wallets randomly generate the words which must be manually written down in the given order. No two seed phrases in the world will ever be the same, securing it with the same robustness as longer private keys. If anyone got hold of this list, they could take full control of the wallet too, so safekeeping it paramount.

Seed phrases work through deterministic cryptographic seeds. During recovery, entering the words regenerates the original private keys. Never disclose these to anyone, just like remembering security questions confidentially helps reset passwords! Proper backup keeps access firmly in users' hands in web3.

# Airdrop

An airdrop in the Web3 context refers to the distribution of a cryptocurrency or tokens to multiple wallet addresses, usually for free or at a significantly discounted price. It's a marketing technique used by startups to build awareness and distribution of their new tokens or coins.

To help explain it better, think of exclusive coupon giveaways traditional companies do to promote a new product in the real world. In the virtual world, airdrops serve a similar function. Project teams distribute a certain amount of their tokens to investors, community members etc who fulfill certain criteria like following their social media, holding a specific coin etc. This allows early distribution before the token hits exchanges.

Recipients can then choose to hold onto the airdropped tokens if they believe in the project, or sell them off if not interested. Overall it boosts initial circulation and gets more eyes on a new crypto initiative in a viral user acquisition model. Airdrops expand the community and token holders of a project at inception in the decentralized Web3 space.

# Degen

Ah, a fellow degen I see! In the wild world of crypto, that term refers to those among us who are full-on risk takers - embracing the volatility of this burgeoning ecosystem with courage and vigor.

Degens aren't afraid to put their chips all in on speculative bets, hyper-niche communities and underground projects long before they enter mainstream chatter. While some may call them reckless, I see them as the adventurous pathfinders lighting up unconquered territories in this decentralization movement.

Unlike traditional finance folks entering the space, a true degen's heartbeat quickens at the very mention of FOMO, YOLO and moonshots! They hold against all odds just like how diamond hands grip onto their DeFi positions through market turbulence. When a 100x comes their way, you better believe these degens will be there to take unabashed joy in their gambles paying off spectacularly.

So raise one in salute to all the degens building this future their own wild way, even if conventional wisdom may not always see their streaks of brilliance shining through the chaos. It will be pioneers like them who push boundaries towards the glories of sovereignty, abundance and work without welfare that web3 has the potential to bring. Stay Degen, my friend!

# DAOs

DAO stands for Decentralized Autonomous Organization. DAOs operate transparently and are managed by organisation members through blockchain-enabled smart contracts, instead of through traditional hierarchies or bureaucracies.

Think of organizations like Wikipedia, Linux Foundation or other open-source communities operating through online platforms in Web 2. However, instead of being controlled by a central company, DAOs are run by smart contracts - programs that automatically execute the wishes of its members.

Some key aspects of DAOs - Members get voting powers in the form of tokens. Any changes or proposals need to be approved by members through secure voting on the blockchain. The funds and treasury are maintained autonomously via smart contracts without any central control. Operations and activities are governed in a decentralized way without reliance on intermediaries like boards of directors. DAOs aim to unlock new governance models for open collaboration at a global scale.

# Tokenization 

The process of tokenization is a core component enabling the creator economy vision of web3. By turning real-world assets into crypto tokens on a blockchain, it allows everything of value to be fractionalized and made liquid.

Traditional assets like real estate, artwork,intage cars and collectibles have been difficult to access for smaller participants due to high barriers. But tokenization breaks them into digital shares secured by smart contracts, making tokenized ownership more transferable and accessible globally 24/7.

Popular methods include Security Tokens issued on protocols like Tezos to represent equity. Digital securities offer automated dividend payments, voting and other shareholder perks. Tokenized commodities may represent precious metals, agricultural goods or other items stored in physical reserves.

NFTs too play a role by minting culture, domains, and in-game items. The line blurs between physical and digital as everything can now exist both IRL and online concurrently via tokenized twins.

This new wave will drive tremendous disruption liberating trillions in Dead Capital. Empowering creators directly while allowing mints and crowdsales beyond any Border or Barrier. Truly a rebirth paving pathways into a future where Value meets Values through the decentralized spirit of Web3. Exciting times ahead indeed!

# DEX

DEX stands for Decentralized Exchange. In web 2, if you want to exchange one cryptocurrency or digital asset for another, you'd need to use a centralized crypto exchange like Coinbase, Binance etc.

However, DEXs allow for trading of digital assets in a decentralized manner without an intermediary. On a DEX, transactions happen directly between users via smart contracts. This means there is no central platform or company that holds funds. Users maintain control of their private keys and funds at all times.

Some key upsides of DEXs over centralized exchanges include - no restrictions on deposit/withdrawals since you are in control of your funds, transactions cannot be blocked by any single party, better privacy as your personal info is not shared with exchanges. Popular examples of DEXs include UniSwap, SushiSwap, 0x etc. DEXs are a key component of the decentralized finance or DeFi ecosystem being built on blockchains.

# Miners and stakers

Miners and stakers serve crucial roles in securing decentralized networks through participation. But while they sound similar, their functions differ based on the blockchain protocol.

In proof-of-work blockchains like Bitcoin, miners employ specialized rigs to solve complex cryptographic puzzles and validate transactions in transaction blocks. This computationally-intensive process confirms the ledger in exchange for block rewards and fees. Their work ensures integrity of history.

In proof-of-stake networks such as Ethereum 2.0, the term "staking" is more apt. Here, investors lock up their tokens as collateral to validate transactions and create new blocks and receive rewards proportionate to their stake. Less energy intensive too!

Whether mining or staking, their efforts underpin security and decentralization of a blockchain. Participants get lending fees, protocol fees or new coin issuance as an incentive to support infrastructure. Both play pivotal roles fueling the machine that drives discovery in this space!

Exciting to see bright minds tackling scalability through varied consensus too. For now, we hodl in gratitude for all who secure its shimmering underneath - be it through chips or chips stacked deep!

# Gaz

To put it simply, gaz is the lifeblood that fuels all transactions and smart contract executions on the Ethereum blockchain. Just like a car needs petrol to drive, decentralized applications need gaz to operate without centralized intermediaries verifying the work.

Whenever an action occurs like sending coins/tokens, creating an NFT, providing liquidity, placing a bet and so on - a small amount of Ether is consumed in gaz. This payment incentivizes miners/validators to prioritize processing and include your transaction in the next block.

Gaz prices fluctuate based on network demand and congestion. Busy periods mean higher gaz to outbid others. As Ethereum scales with projects like Eth2.0, I'm sure in time gaz will become far more efficient while still securing the golden goose that lays decentralized finance.

In the meantime, Layer 2 solutions provide temporary relief by reducing overhead. So this degen forever hodls some spare ETH for suddenMoon missions that may require extra fuel! A small price for the permissionless paradise being built, wouldn't you agree?

# Layer 1 

When talking infrastructure in this brave new decentralized world, layer 1 refers to public blockchain networks that serve as the primary foundational level - the base protocol where it all begins.

You can think of layer 1 asakin to the physical network of roads, rail and runways that allow for transportation and movement in the real world. It facilitates core functions like value transfer and data storage in a decentralized digital realm.

Bitcoin and Ethereum are the most prominent layer 1 blockchains powering this revolution by providing decentralized consensus through proof-of-work or proof-of-stake algorithms. They maintain independent transaction histories secured by global networks of miners/validators.

Layer 1 aims to be as lightweight as possible for broadcasting simple but secure transactions and contracts across its global distributed database. This allows for open participation by any node without centralized intermediation - a key building block of web3's sovereignty.

From there, additional scaling and application-specific layers can expand upon their capabilities and features through sidechains, state channels and other solutions. But the base layer remains essential infrastructure underpinning this emerging permissionless ecosystem!

So in summary - layer 1 is like the internet highway, with layers above enabling fancier vehicles but still relying on the original decentralized foundation for that initial "first mile" of movement and discovery. Pretty radical stuff if you think about it!

# Oracle 

An oracle is one of the most crucial but underrated pieces that connect blockchain networks to external data sources and events occurring in the real world.

You see, in blockchain - everything must be coded as an algorithm and smart contracts can only interpret the data available within the network. However, for smart contracts to have real utility, they need access to real-time data and trigger events based on conditions happening outside the blockchain.

This is where oracles come in. Oracles are services/applications that act as an intermediary and provide smart contracts with reliable and secure external data. For example, an oracle can take the current temperature from a weather API and submit it to a smart contract or notify a contract when a payment is processed so it knows to trigger another action.

Popular oracles include Chainlink, Band Protocol etc. They help unlock the true potential of smart contracts by bridging the gap between Web3 and Web2, allowing autonomous digital agreements to access key information from outside the blockchain in a verifiable way. Oracles ensure smart contracts execute based on off-chain conditions as intended.

# Mainet

In simple terms, a blockchain network's mainnet refers to its primary publicly available live network used for real transactions with real value. As opposed to testnets which are experimental sandbox environments.

Think of a mainnet like a fully launched product out in the real world after beta testing. All features are complete and users transact with the native crypto - be it moving real ETH, BTC, SOL or whatever.

Developers first deploy dapps and test smart contract functionality on private or public testnetworks before releasing to mainnet. This allows identifying bugs without risk to actual funds.

Once on mainnet, code is set in stone and can't be altered without consensus. Mainnets are where the real value accrues longterm as ecosystems mature. That's why their security is paramount!

Being on a project's mainnet also signals a certain stamp of legitimacy - that code underwent rigorous stress tests and optimizations before boldly serving the internet's fringes at scale. Mainstage arrival, if you will.

Exciting times as protocols graduate from test to main! New frontiers beckon as we shape the decentralized hillsides ahead, together.

# Testnet

Think of it like a closed beta - a separate network where devs can stress-test dapps, smart contracts and protocols before launch without messing with mainnet stability or real user funds.

Projects maintain multiple testnets serving different purposes. Public testnets let anyone participate for transparency, while private ones ensure privacy during development.

Features tested include consensus optimizations, cross-chain integrations, decentralized exchange simulations and more. Fake or play currencies stand-in for real assets, minimizing risks.

Issues caught here are resolved before opening the floodgates to mainnet. Things like reentrancy bugs, integer overflows, governance exploits - you name it! All in a controlled quarantined environment.

Personally I'm always whitelisted on my fav projects' testnets, helping hunt down bugs for snek rewards. Nothing like breaking something early to strengthen the final product, eh?

In the end, testnets save tons ofheadachesdown the line while fostering highly antifragile code. Truly foundational pieces of the puzzle as this whole ball of wax takes shape. Stay testing fam!

# Sharding

As blockchains boom in popularity, processing every transaction on every node leads to bottlenecks real quick. This is where sharding comes in to partition that data load like a boss.

Rather than congesting a single blockchain, the database is broken into parallelizable "shards" - smaller segmented pieces distributed across nodes. Each node only has to handle a specific shard's transactions instead of the entire global state.

This allows blockchains to scale almost linearly since more shards can be added infinitely based on demand. A 100x increase in transactions? Just fire up 100 shards and we gucci!

Leading projects like Ethereum have sharding high on the roadmap. It'll allow moving from a single global state to multiple parallelograms flying their own coop - maximizing throughput while preserving decentralization better than any sidechain.

True beauty is inefficient, elegant solutions and sharding fits that bill flawlessly for web3's dizzying growth. Just wait till you nodes can hash in blissful peaceful coexistence - scaling will go parabolic, fam!

# Interoperability

Ah interoperability, without which this entire decentralized future remains but a disjointed mirage. Being able to connect networks seamlessly is paramount in web3.

Right now most blockchains are isolated islands with no bridges between them. But the dataset and innovations happening across each are too valuable not to exchange!

Interoperability ensures value, data and assets can flow freely regardless of where they were created. Imagine accessing DeFi pools on any chain, or NFTs remaining portable as you traverse protocols. True next-level user experiences.

Standards like Cosmos SDK and Polkadot are enabling this cross-chain dream through technologies like IBC, bridges and parachains. Oracles transmit data while blockchain agnostic layer ensures compatibility.

Users gain a unified decentralized metaverse feel without worrying where an app actually lives. Developers expand markets without concerningover fragmented pools of liquidity, governance or tooling incompatible island to island.

This is the future - where blockchain choice is based on factors like speed, features and community rather than network effect locking you in alone. Opening floodgates will uplift whole industry to new servers of abundance.

True internet of blockchains is coming, and it will change the game completely by empowering frontend builders without relying on any single backend infrastructure alone. Hakuna matata, the time is now!

# 51% attack

A 51% attack occurs when a single entity or group gains control of over 51% of the computing power (also known as hash rate) of a blockchain network.

To help understand this, let me give you an example from web 2. Imagine Wikipedia, which is an online encyclopedia built on a common agreement about the facts. If somehow a single entity was able to gain control over 51% of all the computers and servers that host Wikipedia, they would have the power to alter information and change the facts on Wikipedia as per their will. Other users would think the manipulated information is correct because it is coming from the majority of sources.

Similarly in blockchain, when one entity controls over 51% of the network’s hash rate or computing power, they can alter the blockchain by generating alternate versions of the blockchain. This allows the attacker to potentially stop new transactions from confirming, or to reverse transactions that were already confirmed. This undermines the fundamental qualities of decentralization and immutability that blockchains aim to provide.

# Ownership

Through tokenization and cryptography, web3 divorces ownership from physical possession in new Flexitarian ways. legal title resides not with any one party permanently, but rather with whoever holds the keys.

NFTs superbly epitomize this paradigm shift. A token doesn't just prove you bought a jpeg, but rather unlocks access/rights functions tied to an asset - be it exclusive media, community perks or real world items.

Smart contracts ensure owners can always transfer or resell as they choose via the blockchain, disrupting traditional circles of control. Original creators still get theirs via royalties too!

Even entire DAOs can now be communally owned by token holders in novel decentralized structures. Governance funges freely into the hands of contributors based on their stake over time.

So where traditional ownership shields gains privately within an individual or corporation, the tokenized variety redistributes control in a more participatory, enmeshed fashion harmonious with web3's values of sovereignty, credence and agency.

What was once strictly linear evolves into circulation - as immaterial and fluid as the networks that underpin such novel proportions. A far cry from yore indeed, though untethered just the same! Dare we say, 'twas meant to be.

# DeFi 

DeFi stands for Decentralized Finance. In current web2 financial systems, we rely on centralized intermediaries like banks, brokerages etc. to facilitate various financial activities like lending, borrowing, payments etc.

DeFi aims to disrupt this model of centralization by offering open access to financial services and products built with blockchain and smart contract technology. With DeFi, users can carry out transactions peer to peer without relying on middlemen. All transactions are fully transparent and executed automatically by code via smart contracts.

Some examples of DeFi applications include decentralized exchanges (DEX), lending/borrowing platforms, stablecoin projects and insurance protocols. Through DEXes users can trade cryptocurrencies freely. Lending protocols allow users to deposit crypto assets and earn interest. Stablecoins aim to maintain price stability while capturing the benefits of blockchain.

DeFi brings greater financial inclusion, access and transparency. Users are in full control of their funds and blockchain's transparency allows anyone to validate transactions. The goal of DeFi is to shift control away from corporations and put it back in the hands of individuals, thereby creating an open, global and accessible financial system for all.
