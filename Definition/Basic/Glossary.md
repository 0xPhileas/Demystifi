# Blockchain

Blockchain is one of the most fundamental technology behind Web 3. You can think of it as a digital ledger or record of transactions that is duplicated and distributed across the entire network of computer systems on the blockchain.

In Web 2, if you want to transfer money to a friend using a banking app for example, the bank's central database will record that transaction. With blockchain in Web 3, there is no central authority that maintains the record - it is hosted by millions of computers across the world. This record of transactions, called blocks, are connected to each other in a chain. This ensures that the record cannot be altered or changed as it is distributed across many computers worldwide. Blockchain brings trust and transparency to the system without the need of a middleman.

# 51% attack

A 51% attack occurs when a single entity or group gains control of over 51% of the computing power (also known as hash rate) of a blockchain network.

To help understand this, let me give you an example from web 2. Imagine Wikipedia, which is an online encyclopedia built on a common agreement about the facts. If somehow a single entity was able to gain control over 51% of all the computers and servers that host Wikipedia, they would have the power to alter information and change the facts on Wikipedia as per their will. Other users would think the manipulated information is correct because it is coming from the majority of sources.

Similarly in blockchain, when one entity controls over 51% of the networkâ€™s hash rate or computing power, they can alter the blockchain by generating alternate versions of the blockchain. This allows the attacker to potentially stop new transactions from confirming, or to reverse transactions that were already confirmed. This undermines the fundamental qualities of decentralization and immutability that blockchains aim to provide.

# DAOs

DAO stands for Decentralized Autonomous Organization. DAOs operate transparently and are managed by organisation members through blockchain-enabled smart contracts, instead of through traditional hierarchies or bureaucracies.

Think of organizations like Wikipedia, Linux Foundation or other open-source communities operating through online platforms in Web 2. However, instead of being controlled by a central company, DAOs are run by smart contracts - programs that automatically execute the wishes of its members.

Some key aspects of DAOs - Members get voting powers in the form of tokens. Any changes or proposals need to be approved by members through secure voting on the blockchain. The funds and treasury are maintained autonomously via smart contracts without any central control. Operations and activities are governed in a decentralized way without reliance on intermediaries like boards of directors. DAOs aim to unlock new governance models for open collaboration at a global scale.

# DEX

DEX stands for Decentralized Exchange. In web 2, if you want to exchange one cryptocurrency or digital asset for another, you'd need to use a centralized crypto exchange like Coinbase, Binance etc.

However, DEXs allow for trading of digital assets in a decentralized manner without an intermediary. On a DEX, transactions happen directly between users via smart contracts. This means there is no central platform or company that holds funds. Users maintain control of their private keys and funds at all times.

Some key upsides of DEXs over centralized exchanges include - no restrictions on deposit/withdrawals since you are in control of your funds, transactions cannot be blocked by any single party, better privacy as your personal info is not shared with exchanges. Popular examples of DEXs include UniSwap, SushiSwap, 0x etc. DEXs are a key component of the decentralized finance or DeFi ecosystem being built on blockchains.

# DeFi 

DeFi stands for Decentralized Finance. In current web2 financial systems, we rely on centralized intermediaries like banks, brokerages etc. to facilitate various financial activities like lending, borrowing, payments etc.

DeFi aims to disrupt this model of centralization by offering open access to financial services and products built with blockchain and smart contract technology. With DeFi, users can carry out transactions peer to peer without relying on middlemen. All transactions are fully transparent and executed automatically by code via smart contracts.

Some examples of DeFi applications include decentralized exchanges (DEX), lending/borrowing platforms, stablecoin projects and insurance protocols. Through DEXes users can trade cryptocurrencies freely. Lending protocols allow users to deposit crypto assets and earn interest. Stablecoins aim to maintain price stability while capturing the benefits of blockchain.

DeFi brings greater financial inclusion, access and transparency. Users are in full control of their funds and blockchain's transparency allows anyone to validate transactions. The goal of DeFi is to shift control away from corporations and put it back in the hands of individuals, thereby creating an open, global and accessible financial system for all.

# Airdrop

An airdrop in the Web3 context refers to the distribution of a cryptocurrency or tokens to multiple wallet addresses, usually for free or at a significantly discounted price. It's a marketing technique used by startups to build awareness and distribution of their new tokens or coins.

To help explain it better, think of exclusive coupon giveaways traditional companies do to promote a new product in the real world. In the virtual world, airdrops serve a similar function. Project teams distribute a certain amount of their tokens to investors, community members etc who fulfill certain criteria like following their social media, holding a specific coin etc. This allows early distribution before the token hits exchanges.

Recipients can then choose to hold onto the airdropped tokens if they believe in the project, or sell them off if not interested. Overall it boosts initial circulation and gets more eyes on a new crypto initiative in a viral user acquisition model. Airdrops expand the community and token holders of a project at inception in the decentralized Web3 space.

# Oracle 

An oracle is one of the most crucial but underrated pieces that connect blockchain networks to external data sources and events occurring in the real world.

You see, in blockchain - everything must be coded as an algorithm and smart contracts can only interpret the data available within the network. However, for smart contracts to have real utility, they need access to real-time data and trigger events based on conditions happening outside the blockchain.

This is where oracles come in. Oracles are services/applications that act as an intermediary and provide smart contracts with reliable and secure external data. For example, an oracle can take the current temperature from a weather API and submit it to a smart contract or notify a contract when a payment is processed so it knows to trigger another action.

Popular oracles include Chainlink, Band Protocol etc. They help unlock the true potential of smart contracts by bridging the gap between Web3 and Web2, allowing autonomous digital agreements to access key information from outside the blockchain in a verifiable way. Oracles ensure smart contracts execute based on off-chain conditions as intended.

# NFT 

NFT stands for Non-Fungible Token. The name pretty much encapsulates what it is - it's a unique digital token that cannot be replaced with something else since it represents something one-of-a-kind.

Let me give you an example to help explain why NFTs are useful. In the physical world, collectibles like artworks and trading cards have value due to their scarcity and authenticity that is intrinsic to owning the original piece. In web2, this concept of originals didn't quite exist in the digital realm as anything online could be endlessly reproduced.

NFTs solve this problem. By attaching a non-exchangeable digital token to an artwork, song, video clip etc., it proves its authenticity and scarcity on the blockchain. Just like how a physical painting has value basis the reputation of the artist, NFTs represent verifiable digital ownership that can be stored and traded. NFTs allow creators to monetize their work and unlock unique experiences for collectors in web3.

# Token

A token in the world of web3 represents a unit of value that is powered by blockchain technology. There are generally two types of tokens - currency tokens and utility tokens.

Currency tokens function like digital money that can be used as a medium of exchange, store of value or unit of account. Popular examples are Bitcoin and Ethereum.

Utility tokens on the other hand are crypto assets that grant users access to specific products or services on a blockchain-based platform or application. Holding a utility token doesn't guarantee ownership in the company but may provide rights to its services. Many platforms launching in web3 issue their own native utility tokens to power transactions.

Tokens derive their value based on demand and usability within a given ecosystem. Currency tokens are valued due to their scarcity and purchasing power while people buy into utility tokens to access future projects. Blockchain's ability to tokenize assets breakthrough new ways to structure incentives for users and developers alike in the collaborative sharing economy of web3.
