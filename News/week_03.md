## Barclays Forecasts FOMC Rate Cuts[^1]

Barclays economists expect PCE inflation to reach 2.4% by end of 2024. They anticipate FOMC to cut rates by 25 basis points at every other meeting starting in March, aiming for a fed funds target range of 4.25-4.50% by end of 2024 and further reductions to 3.25-3.50% by 2025. This projection aligns with the expectation of continued moderation in inflation measures and reflects economic, not political, considerations.

## UN Report Highlights Tether's Role in Organized Crime[^2]

The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) has warned that Tether, a stablecoin cryptocurrency, is increasingly being used by criminals for money laundering and fraud in East and Southeast Asia. The UN report emphasizes Tether's appeal to illicit actors due to its stability, ease of use, and low fees. The cryptocurrency's involvement in cyber fraud, money laundering, and online gambling is contributing to the growth of the illicit digital economy in the region. Tether's lack of transparency and the regulatory gaps in the cryptocurrency industry are also highlighted in the report.
