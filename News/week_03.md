## Barclays Forecasts FOMC Rate Cuts[^1]

Barclays economists expect PCE inflation to reach 2.4% by end of 2024. They anticipate FOMC to cut rates by 25 basis points at every other meeting starting in March, aiming for a fed funds target range of 4.25-4.50% by end of 2024 and further reductions to 3.25-3.50% by 2025. This projection aligns with the expectation of continued moderation in inflation measures and reflects economic, not political, considerations.
